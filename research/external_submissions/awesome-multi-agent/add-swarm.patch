+## Frameworks & Tools
+- **SWARM: System-Wide Assessment of Risk in Multi-agent systems** [[code]](https://github.com/swarm-ai-safety/swarm) [[install]](https://pypi.org/project/swarm-safety/)
+  - A distributional safety simulation framework for studying emergent risks in multi-agent AI systems.
+  - Uses soft (probabilistic) labels instead of binary classifications to measure toxicity, adverse selection, and governance effectiveness.
+  - Built-in agent archetypes (honest, opportunistic, deceptive, adversarial, LLM-backed) and governance levers (taxes, reputation, circuit breakers, audits).
+  - YAML-driven scenarios, parameter sweeps, and full replay support for reproducible multi-agent experiments.
