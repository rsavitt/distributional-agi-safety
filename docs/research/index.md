## Core Research Questions

SWARM addresses fundamental questions in multi-agent AI safety:

1. **Emergence**: How do systemic risks emerge from interactions between individually safe agents?

2. **Measurement**: How can we measure harm probabilistically rather than binary classification?

3. **Governance**: What mechanisms effectively mitigate collective risks without over-constraining beneficial activity?

4. **Scaling**: How do risks scale with agent count, capability, and interaction frequency?
